# PHOTOMOSAICS

Learning the basics of image processing by implementing a basic photomosaics program using OpenCV.

## HOW TO USE

Add all the images you want to see in the final results to the [source](Source_Images) folder. <br>
Simply run ``python photomosaics.py 'input' 'tile_size'``, with 'input' being the path to your input image and 'tile_size' being the precision you want to use(A low tile_size means a higher precision). Keep in mind that the lower 'tile_size' is, the longer the program will take to run.
